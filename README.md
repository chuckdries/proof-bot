# Proof Bot

The idea is for photography discords - you post your pictures in a channel called #proofs in batches of 10, and other people in the channel react with the number of the pictures that they like. This bot pre-reacts with the appropriate numbers so users don't have to dig through the emoji picker to find them.

To invite this bot to your server, go to https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=969443608639963206&permissions=64&scope=bot

To host this bot yourself, create a file called `.env` with
```
BOT_TOKEN=<your discord bot token here>
```
